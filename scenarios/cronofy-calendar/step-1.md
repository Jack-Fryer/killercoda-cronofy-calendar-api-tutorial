1. Go to the [Cronofy Developer Console](https://app.cronofy.com/sign_up/developer) and create a free account.  
2. Click **“Create New Application”**  
3. Name it anything you like, like 'Calendar API Test'.  
4. Set the **URL** to:

```
http://127.0.0.1
```

> (We won’t use this for this tutorial, but it’s required)

After creating the application, copy your:
- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

## 🔑 2. Authorize access to your calendar

Scroll down the page and click 'Connect a calendar for your account' and go through the oAuth flow in your browser. 

After authorizing Cronofy access to your calendar, scroll down the page and copy your:
- **Access Token**
- **Calendar ID**
  
> 👉 You'll need your Access Token in the next step!
